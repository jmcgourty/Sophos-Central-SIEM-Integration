This repository contains a script package to export event and alert data from Sophos Central into a SIEM solution.

Any issue discovered using the script should be reported to Sophos Support.


### SIEM

The script in this directory allows you to use the Sophos Central API to get data into your SIEM solution.

Access to the APIs requires an access token that can be setup in the Sophos Central UI by going to System Settings from the navigation bar and then selecting API Token Management. From this page, you can click the Add Token button to create a new token.
Here is more information available on how to setup API Token: https://community.sophos.com/kb/en-us/125169

You can view API Swagger Specification by accessing API Access URL from the access token created under Api Token Management in Sophos Central UI.

### Configuration ###

The script gets the last 12 hours of events on its initial run. A maximum of 24 hours of historical data can be retrieved. The script keeps tab of its state,â€‚it will always pick-up from where it left off based on a state file stored in the state folder. The script calls the server until there are no more events available. There is also a built-in retry mechanism if there are any network issues. The script exits if there are no more events available or when retry fails. In this case the next scheduled run of the script will pick-up state from the last run using the state file.

Set the SOPHOS_SIEM_HOME environment variable to point to the folder where config.ini, siem_cef_mapping.txt, state and log folders will be located. state and log folders are created when the script is run for the first time.

config.ini is a configuration file that exists by default in the siem-scripts folder.

##### Here are the steps to configure the script:
1. Open config.ini in a text editor.
2. Under 'API Access URL + Headers' in the config file, copy and paste the API Access URL + Headers block from the Api Token Management page in Sophos Central.

##### Optional configuration steps:
1. Under json, cef or keyvalue, you could choose the preferred output of the response i.e. json, cef or keyvalue.
2. Under filename, you can specify the filename that your output would be saved to. Options are syslog, stdout or any custom file name. Custom files are created in a folder named log.
3. If you are using syslog then under syslog properties in the config file, configure address, facility and socktype.


### Running the script

Run 'python siem.py' and you should see the results as specified in the config file.
For more options and help on running the script run 'python siem.py -h'
